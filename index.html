		<h1>Untitled Boxing Game</h1> 

		<div>
			<p>Untitled Boxing Game is a fighting game where you use various different fighting styles in order to beat your opponent in a 1-to-1 boxing match. This game is based on the anime "Hajime no Ippo".</p>
			<p>Some styles in this game are the "Ghost" style, where you have access to a jab that is so fast you can't see it, the "Corkscrew" style, where you have increased regeneration compared to normal, and the "Hands Low" style, where you have lower base damage but increased counter damage.</p>
